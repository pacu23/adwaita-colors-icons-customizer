# adwaita-colors-icons-customizer
AI-generated script to customize the colors of the Adwaita Colors icon pack.

**Required: bc (for calculating the "darker" color, MoreWaita and Adwaita Colors installed.**

Creates custom theme in ~/.local/share/icons, recoloring SVGs. Prompts you for a light and a dark color hex. Make sure the contrast is good. Dark color could be your system's accent, light should be very light, as in Adwaita's folders.

Option to include or exclude the MoreWaita app icons.
