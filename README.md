# adwaita-colors-icons-customizer
AI-generated script to customize the colors of the Adwaita Colors icon pack.

Required: MoreWaita and Adwaita Colors installed.

Prompts you for a light and a dark color hex. Make sure the contrast is good. Dark color could be your system's accent, light should be very light, as in Adwaita's folders.

Option to include or exclude the MoreWaita app icons. If excluded, had to also exclude MoreWaita's scalable app icons because they caused issues, but it shouldn't matter unless you specifically need them.
